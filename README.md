# C++ Algorithms & Competitive Programming 🚀

Welcome to my training repository! Here I document my journey in mastering C++ and solving complex algorithmic problems.

This collection includes solutions ranging from basic syntax exercises to advanced competitive programming challenges, with a focus on code efficiency and optimization.

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Techniques
I implemented solutions covering various computer science topics, including:

* **Searching & Sorting:**
    * Binary Search
    * Two Pointers Technique
* **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
    * Knapsack Problems
    * Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
* **Greedy Algorithms:**
    * Optimization problems
    * Interval Scheduling
* **Data Structures:**
    * Vectors, Maps, Stacks, Queues

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++ (STL - Standard Template Library)
* **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

## 📂 Project Structure
This repository is organized into folders. Since I use **Visual Studio**, you will find `.sln` (Solution) and `.vcxproj` (Project) files.

### How to run the code:
1.  **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `.sln` file using **Visual Studio**.
3.  Select the project you want to run as the *Startup Project*.
4.  Build and Run (F5).


**PS** All the programs were done in 2025, the year in the folder's names corresponds to the name of a certain exercise
